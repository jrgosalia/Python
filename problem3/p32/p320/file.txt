One piece of advice for fi rst year students:
The Computer Science major can be challenging and intimidating at fi rst, but never
give up. Take advantage of the summer internships which will give you hands-on
experience. That way you will have a better idea of what you would like to do in the
future (networking, Web development, research, teaching). Also, take advantage
of on-campus work opportunities at the Help Desk or a multimedia center, creating
applications for departments and student organizations, or even doing research for a
professor.

What’s the most interesting project you’ve worked on as a professional?
I have worked on several interesting projects for diff erent government agencies. One
of the most recent of these was AEIS (Academic Exchange Information System) at the
Bureau of Educational and Cultural Aff airs at the Department of State, Washington
DC. AEIS is Web-based and gathers data received from exchange program agencies
and institutions. It also provides the means for capturing and modifying as well as
reporting on program data. I have worked on all aspects of the software development
life cycle, but the rewarding part at the end of the day is to see the system live and
working, and to see users happy with it. I have learned to take simple, basic concepts
that I learned from my computer science courses and use them in learning new
programming languages, in daily research at work, and in analyzing and problem
solving.

Where do you see yourself in ten years?
I see myself a leader in technology, carrying a Master’s degree and contributing my
abilities in an innovative, challenging, and rewarding environment. I also see myself
teaching and mentoring new graduates, showing them the path to advancement and
success.
